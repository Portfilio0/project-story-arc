These insights guided the design of a more efficient and user-friendly solution that aligns with user needs and expectations.\n\nMethodology\nUser Surveys:\nDesign: I designed an online survey with structured questions aimed at understanding users' frequency of app usage, common tasks performed, and the challenges faced, especially related to beneficiary management and payment processes.\nDistribution: The survey was distributed to a diverse group of users through email and social media platforms, targeting users who frequently engage in digital banking./nSample Size:/nI received responses from 40 users, providing a substantial dataset to analyze trends and patterns in user behavior.",
